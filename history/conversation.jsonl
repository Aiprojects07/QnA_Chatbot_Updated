Reads more peach than pink and sits in the mid-depth nude range (not very light, not dark). Verified as shade 120 \"Can't Even\" across multiple retailer listings and swatch images; the formula is richly pigmented. Color Family: Nude Finish: Matte - soft, satiny matte; not glossy or shiny ## Skintone Analysis ## Fair Indian Skin Q: How does [shade] look on fair Indian skin tones (NC15-NC25)? How It Looks: Shows up as a warm peachy nude that can lean slightly orange. On very fair or cool-leaning skin, it can look a touch strong compared to the rest of the face. Does It Flatter: Sometimes Absolutely Stunning: False Is Mlbb: False Bareface Check: Can look a bit bold or warm on a bare face; adding a little base makeup or a soft peach/coral blush helps it blend in. Solution If Unflattering: Soften with a neutral brown or pink-brown lip liner, apply a light layer and blot once; pair with peach/bronze blush to balance warmth. Why: The shade's warm terracotta-peach undertone adds noticeable warmth on lighter skin. Because it's mid-depth and high in pigment, the contrast can feel stronger, especially on cool or very fair complexions. ## Medium Indian Skin Q: How does [shade] look on medium Indian skin tones (NC25-NC35)? How It Looks: A flattering warm nude that reads peach-brown—polished and everyday-friendly without washing you out. Does It Flatter: Yes Absolutely Stunning: False Is Mlbb: False Bareface Check: Works well even with minimal makeup; a touch of mascara and soft blush is enough. Why: Medium Indian skin often carries golden/olive warmth, which syncs well with the shade's peachy-brown base. The mid-depth color sits close to natural lip depth, so it looks balanced rather than too bright or too pale. ## Deeper Indian Skin Q: How does [shade] look on deeper Indian skin tones (NC45+)? How It Looks: Leans like a lighter warm nude; on very deep tones it can appear a bit pastel or too peach if worn alone. Does It Flatter: Sometimes Absolutely Stunning: False Is Mlbb: False Bareface Check: May wash out on a bare face; needs definition to avoid looking chalky. Solution If Unflattering: Outline and slightly fill with a rich brown lip liner (chocolate/brick), then apply this shade in the center and blend; adding a gloss with caramel/amber tint also helps. Why: The warm peachy undertone and mid-lightness of the color can contrast with deeper complexions, making it look lighter. A deeper liner lowers the contrast and adds depth so the nude reads intentional and flattering. ## Two Toned Lips Q: Is this lipstick shade recommended for two-toned lips? Answer: Yes, it can work, but prep and a liner help. The crayon is high-pigment and gives good coverage, yet the warm peach nude can highlight darker edges if applied alone. Solution: Gently blur lip edges with a thin layer of concealer or a peach/orange corrector, line with a deep brown liner, then apply the crayon and press lips together to blend. For stubborn darkness, fill lips 50% with the liner first and layer the crayon on top. Why: The formula is creamy with strong payoff, so it covers uneven tone well. Because the color is warm and mid-depth, pairing it with a deeper liner evens out contrast and keeps the nude from turning patchy on pigmented areas."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the shade breakdown, here's how **Milani 120 Can't Even** lands on Indian skin tones:\n\n**Medium Indian skin (NC25-NC35):** This is your sweet spot! The warm peachy-brown reads as a flattering everyday nude that won't wash you out. The shade's golden warmth syncs beautifully with the natural undertones common in medium Indian skin.\n\n**Fair Indian skin (NC15-NC25):** It'll show up as a warm peachy nude that can lean slightly orange—potentially a touch strong on very fair or cool-leaning skin. If it feels bold, soften it with a neutral brown or pink-brown liner, blot once, and pair with peach/bronze blush to balance.\n\n**Deeper Indian skin (NC45+):** The shade reads lighter and can appear a bit pastel or too peachy when worn alone. Outline with a rich chocolate or brick brown liner, apply this in the center, and blend—or add a caramel/amber-tinted gloss for depth so it doesn't wash out.\n\n**Pro tip for pigmented lips:** This crayon has strong payoff, so if you have darker lip edges, use a brown liner to define first, then layer the shade on top to avoid patchiness.\n\nWhich skin tone are you working with? I can give you more specific application tips! 💋"}
